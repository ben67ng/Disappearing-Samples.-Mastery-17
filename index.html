    <li>
      <strong>What needs to be improved in public transport?</strong><br><br>
      To begin with, the most pressing issue is reliability, since buses and trains
      in many cities are frequently delayed, which undermines people’s confidence
      in the system. Moreover, comfort should not be overlooked; overcrowded
      vehicles make commuting both stressful and exhausting. What’s more,
      digital improvements such as real-time tracking apps and contactless payments
      could transform public transport into a far more convenient and appealing
      option. Ultimately, unless these aspects are addressed, many people will
      continue to rely on private vehicles.

    <li>
      <strong>Will there be fewer cars if public transport is free?</strong><br><br>
      While it’s true that making public transport free might encourage certain
      groups, such as students or low-income workers, to switch, I don’t think it
      would significantly reduce car use overall. This is because convenience
      often outweighs cost: drivers can travel directly from door to door, whereas
      public transport still involves waiting and transferring. On balance, I
      believe that speed, coverage, and efficiency are far more decisive factors
      than price.

    <li>
      <strong>Who likes to travel more, older people or younger people?</strong><br><br>
      It’s difficult to generalize, but I would argue that younger people tend to
      travel more frequently. One reason is that they usually have fewer family or
      financial responsibilities, which gives them greater freedom to explore. In
      addition, they often seek out adventurous experiences, such as backpacking
      or hiking, that appeal less to older generations. Having said that, older
      people also enjoy traveling, though they are more inclined to choose
      comfortable or culturally enriching trips, such as cruises or guided tours.
      In short, both groups like traveling, but they do so for rather different
      reasons.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Will people travel abroad more often if air travel becomes cheaper?</strong><br><br>
      In my view, lower ticket prices would certainly lead to a rise in international
      travel, particularly among young adults and families who are currently
      restricted by cost. After all, many people already have the desire to see new
      place
