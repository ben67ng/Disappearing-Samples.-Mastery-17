    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What needs to be improved in public transport?</strong><br><br>
        To begin with, the most pressing issue is reliability, since buses and trains
        in many cities are frequently delayed, which undermines people’s confidence
        in the system. Moreover, comfort should not be overlooked; overcrowded
        vehicles make commuting both stressful and exhausting. What’s more,
        digital improvements such as real-time tracking apps and contactless payments
        could transform public transport into a far more convenient and appealing
        option. Ultimately, unless these aspects are addressed, many people will
        continue to rely on private vehicles.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Will there be fewer cars if public transport is free?</strong><br><br>
        While it’s true that making public transport free might encourage certain
        groups, such as students or low-income workers, to switch, I don’t think it
        would significantly reduce car use overall. This is because convenience
        often outweighs cost: drivers can travel directly from door to door, whereas
        public transport still involves waiting and transferring. On balance, I
        believe that speed, coverage, and efficiency are far more decisive factors
        than price.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Who likes to travel more, older people or younger people?</strong><br><br>
        It’s difficult to generalize, but I would argue that younger people tend to
        travel more frequently. One reason is that they usually have fewer family or
        financial responsibilities, which gives them greater freedom to explore. In
        addition, they often seek out adventurous experiences, such as backpacking
        or hiking, that appeal less to older generations. Having said that, older
        people also enjoy traveling, though they are more inclined to choose
        comfortable or culturally enriching trips, such as cruises or guided tours.
        In short, both groups like traveling, but they do so for rather different
        reasons.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Will people travel abroad more often if air travel becomes cheaper?</strong><br><br>
        In my view, lower ticket prices would certainly lead to a rise in international
        travel, particularly among young adults and families who are currently
        restricted by cost. After all, many people already have the desire to see new
        places, and what holds them back is financial rather than motivational.
        However, it is worth pointing out that growing awareness of environmental
        issues might restrain this trend. So while cheaper air travel would no doubt
        increase demand, in the long run, governments may have to balance
        affordability with sustainability.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>What will become more popular in the future: air travel or train travel?</strong><br><br>
        That very much depends on the distance involved. For cross-continental
        journeys, air travel will almost certainly remain dominant, simply because it
        is so much faster. By contrast, within countries or across short international
        routes, high-speed trains are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in
        Europe and parts of Asia, as they are more environmentally friendly and take
        passengers directly from city center to city center. Personally, I expect
        trains to expand their share of the market, but it is hard to imagine a future
        where airplanes are not the preferred option for long-haul travel.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sea travel?</strong><br><br>
        On the positive side, sea travel can be uniquely relaxing, since passengers
        are able to enjoy the open scenery and benefit from a slower pace of life. In
        addition, cruise ships often provide a wide range of entertainment and
        facilities, which makes the journey itself part of the holiday. Nevertheless,
        there are clear drawbacks: it is considerably slower than air or rail travel,
        it can be highly weather-dependent, and for many routes it is simply
        impractical. Consequently, while sea travel does have its advantages, it is
        likely to remain a niche option, chosen more for leisure than for everyday
        transport.
